# Project Title:
Butterfly Sparkles


## Description:



## Get started

1. Select one javascript template above. 
2. Change line 15 of the [index.html](index.html) file to the name of your template!
4. Run your code locally using `http-server` or the `VSCode Go Live` option.
5. Sometimes you may need to hard-refresh for your changes to load. In those cases, use `COMMAND + SHIFT + R`.

## Here are templates and resources you can find elsewhere.
