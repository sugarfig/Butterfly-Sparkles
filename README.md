# Assignment 2: Make a reverse-engineered Snap Lens

Here are the requirements: 

1. VARIABLES: Based on a poseNet keypoint position (this is an object with a x and y property) in ml5, activate at least one change in p5.js (display an image,run an animation,change the screen in some way, etc.).
2. EVENTS: Write some logic so that when an event happens (if you raise your hand, or if you make a certain gesture, etc.), activate at least one change in p5.js.

## Here are the javascript templates in this repo that you can use!

1. [Nose Brush using ml5 PoseNet](./script_nosebrush.js)
2. [Body Lens using ml5 PoseNet](./script_posenet.js)
3. [Face Lens using ml5 Face API](./script_faceapi.js)
4. [Face Lens using ml5 Face Mesh](./script_facemesh.js)


## Get started

1. Select one javascript template above. 
2. Change line 15 of the [index.html](index.html) file to the name of your template!
4. Run your code locally using `http-server` or the `VSCode Go Live` option.
5. Sometimes you may need to hard-refresh for your changes to load. In those cases, use `COMMAND + SHIFT + R`.

## Here are templates and resources you can find elsewhere.
